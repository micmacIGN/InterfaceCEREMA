History of the main versions of the CEREMA AperoDeDenis interface


			Version 5.55: 24 November 2020
			
			functional novelties :
              - Adding the schnapps module after Tapioca : detects photos to reject
              - Help for entering GPS points: circle centred on the probable position
              - Display of homologous points on photos
              - use of 'reduced' homologous points per schnapps
			
			Improvements :
              - Customised options for schnapps
              - Possibility to open 'wide' the photos being viewed.
              - Addition, in the help section, of a presentation of the ... photogrammetry
              - Sometimes AperoDeDenis stopped after a MicMac crash, it's been corrected
              - Leaving the interface: active mm3d modules are killed 
              - Improved speed for searching for exifs
              - Adding a 'tips and tricks' item in the help file
              - search in the traces: case-insensitive
              - some changes in vocabulary: see the source
			  - all updated translations (en,de,it,es,ar,zh)

            Version 5.54: August 21, 2020
			
				- translation corrections: the word "mistresses" was sometimes misinterpreted!
				- 'Fraser' becomes the default option for Tapas
				
            Version 5.53 : August 14, 2020
			  
              What's New : 
              - Taking into account the offset for GPS or UAV sites: white bands in dense clouds are removed. 
                This white stripes effect is due to the large values of the coordinates. The offset used is displayed in the status of the construction site. 
              - Possibility to define several customized parameters for each MicMac module. 
              - Add option 'Circ=0' for Tapioca Line, by default the photos of the building site do not 'loop'. 
              - Adding the fusion of orthomosaics by Gdal_merge, allows to generate custom orthomosaics.  
              - Adding an item in the Help menu: if several focal lengths, several dimensions, several cameras
			  - Redesign of the Edit and Help menus: distribution of items in several sub-menus
              - Additions and corrections to messages, including : 
                Adding the orthomosaic path in the consultation dialog box 
                Addition of 2 warnings in the state of the building site: if several focal lengths or several dimensions of photos 
                Adding the size of the building site in the 'household' dialog box!

			  - Miscellaneous modifications, bug fixes: see at the top of the script
				
			Version 5.52 of July 8, 2020 :

					- Calculate the volume between 2 DTM
					- View the difference between the 2 DTMs
					- Writing an XYZ file from a PLY
				- Added 2 items in the Edit menu to get information about a PLY file.
					
				- the item "Write a DTM from a PLY", present in version 5.50 under the expert menu, 
				  is moved under the menu 'Business Tools', the GRASS format is no longer written
				
				- Miscellaneous modifications, bug fixes: see at the top of the script
