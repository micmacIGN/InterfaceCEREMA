The photo "rayon vert à Merlimont" was added following a discussion on 
			Wednesday evening, 2021 December 1, with the participants of the 3D consortium for SHS
			consortium at the Montaigne University in Bordeaux. This exceptional photo recorded
			the last rays of the sun, tinged with green, on October 8, 2008 on the beach
			of Merlimont. Thanks to its author, Gilles Troispoux, who took the picture without knowing
			the phenomenon known as "the green ray".
